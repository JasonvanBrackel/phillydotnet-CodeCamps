### Presented by: Jeffrey T. Fritz

#### Overview
The arrival of WebAssembly begins a new era for .NET web developers, allowing client-side applications written in C# to run directly in the browser. 

Blazor is a new client-side UI platform from the ASP.NET Core team, offering a productive and powerful way to construct large-scale applications with a modern component-based architecture. It integrates with the wider .NET ecosystem to enable truly full-stack client+server development on a single language and runtime, based on modern standards, and able to run in any browser (including mobiles). 

This session will quickly take you from getting started with Blazor basics, right through to building sophisticated UIs using advanced framework features. We’ll explore not only the capabilities of Blazor and WebAssembly today, but also the longer-term vision for the future of web apps on .NET.
