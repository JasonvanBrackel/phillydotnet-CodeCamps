# Astro for Rank Beginners

## Short Link to This Content: 

### Presented by: Nick Hodges

#### Overview
Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript, leveraging partial hydration and enabling developers to build sites using a component-based architecture with support for various frontend frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte. If that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, then this session is for you.  

This session is for anyone who has precisely zero knowledge about Astro and wants to walk away with a basic knowledge of what it is and how it works.  We'll start from scratch and build an incredibly simple application.  You'll walk away knowing how a simple Astro application is structured and how it works.

By the end of this workshop, you will have built your own fully functional blog and personal website using Astro.

We'll cover

* Intro to Astro, what it is, and why you'd choose it
* Setting up your environment for Astro
* Anatomy of an Astro application
* Basic routing
* Managing Content in Content Collections
* Markdown and MDX
* Rendering strategies (SSR vs. SSG)
* Integrating React
* Deploying to Vercel

The workshop will assume you have basic knowledge of web development, including HTML, basic CSS, GitHub, and TypeScript.
