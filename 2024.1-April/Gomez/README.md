# Blazor in .NET 8

## Short Link to This Content: 

### Presented by: Chris Gomez

#### Overview
.NET 8 shipped with an updated version of the Blazor framework in ASP.NET Core.  While veterans of ASP.NET Core, Razor templating, and Blazor itself will be familiar with the new version, there are significant updates to how Blazor works.

This session is a fast-paced walkthrough of key areas about Blazor in .NET 8.  This should give developers a good head start on using Blazor whether you have used it before or not.  

There will be a short introduction on what Blazor is, but the intention is not to dwell on this.  The plan is to learn through code.

The focus areas are:

- The File > New Project Experience
- Render Modes - the key concept to know in Blazor in .NET 8
- Components, including how you might maintain state across components
- Authentication / Authorization, what's built in and what's not
